# Techno-song

My project is heavily inspired by Skin On Skin's "Way Ur Touchin Me". I am very interested in music, and in techno more specifically, and I thought this was a unique project for me to recreat that song to the best of my ability, whilst also making it my own. I was only able to do around 30 seconds of it, afterall it took be 6 weeks, but i'm quite happy with it as I've never had experience with code before. Files are uploaded - enjoy!
